# cy-sw-caching-example

> An example showing how the app's ServiceWorker can accidentally cache the Cypress spec itself

This example uses [`next-pwa`](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa) to create a progressive web app (PWA) powered by [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/).

Used as an example for lessons in [Cypress Network Testing Exercises](https://cypress.tips/courses/network-testing).
